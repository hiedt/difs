# Contribution Guideline

## Development Environment Setup

1. Make a Python environment using `conda` or `mamba`
2. (optional) As Sphinx is installed by default as a dependency of `jupyter-book`, we only need to install some third-party extensions.
3. Restructure the book folder by modifying `_config.yml` and `_toc.yml`.
4. (optional) Extract Sphinx `config.py` for finer settings. Go to step 5b, then.
5. (a) Build with `jupyter-book` CLI.
(b) Build with `sphinx-build` CLI.
