# Welcome to A Primer on Modern Control Algorithms (APOMCA)

In an era functioned by automation and intelligent systems, control theory has become more vital than ever. From precise movements of robotic arms to complex regulation of climate systems, modern control algorithms are the silent architects of our technological world.

APOMCA, written by a graduate student in a pragmatic language, is designed to be your accessible gateway into this fascinating domain. We aim to demystify core concepts, bridging the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications without overloading mathematics. Whether you are a student, an industrial practitioner, or simply a curious mind, this primer will equip you with the most fundamental knowledge needed to get contemporary control strategies up running.

## Target Audiences

First and foremost, our future selves. If you are interested in these topics, welcome home fellas.

- Advanced feedback control: optimal/robust/model-reference/predictive control, etc.
- Dynamical systems of many kinds: linear/non-linear, switch, continuous/discrete, etc.
- Analyze those concepts in Python and MATLAB
- Implement binary executables on microcontrollers
- and hopefully more.

## To Use This Blog Effectively

This blog does not have any numbered chapters. Instead, it is organized as a Wiki-like knowledge base. Readers start by searching a keyword, e.g., "Observability" to open its primary section. From here, you can easily find related pages in the graph view (bottom-right corner).

Each page starts with preliminary knowledge and ends with basic exercises. Answers can be found in [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/hiedt/difs/tree/master/apomca_sol).
