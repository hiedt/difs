# DIFS - DO IT FROM SCRATCH

Everything I have learned, from data structures & algorithms to machine learning & robotics, is coded solely from scratch.

This repository contains the following projects:

1. **APOMCA**: a tech blog on modern control algorithms with exercises and solutions (Julia)
2. **Draft**: some homework, presentations, assignments, etc. during my degrees (Python, MATLAB/Simulink)
3. **FHAgent**: my Master's thesis (*to be migrated from another repo soon*)
4. **Apomca-lib**: a C++20 library for building embedded control applications based on algorithms mentioned in the APOMCA blog. C++ solutions to selected exercises are also made with this library.
