In week 9 and 10, we have learnt some methods to generate residuals. The lectures this week are about a decision algorithm (CUSUM) to determine the occurrence and time of occurrence a fault using those generated residuals.

In other words, we are answering two questions:

- is a fault happening?
- since when did it start?
